# Fibonacci-numbers-python

This document describes how to generate any element of the Fibonacci sequence. At the beginning I present different functions which allow to get the *N-th* element of these numbers. Going through the comparison of their speeds I choose the fastest one and then optimizing it, I finally print a ready-to-use code.

## Requirements

The document was prepared with usage *Python 3.4* and the following package:

 * *matplotlib 2.1.0*
